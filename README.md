A Cellular network or Mobile network is a radio network distributed over land areas called cells, each served by at least one fixed-location transceiver, known as a cell site or base station. In a cellular network, each cell uses a different set of frequencies from neighboring cells, to avoid interference and provide guaranteed bandwidth within each cell.

## Advantages of Cellular networks :

● It is flexible enough to use the features and functions of almost all public and private networks.

● It has increased capacity.

● It consumes less power.

● It can be distributed to larger coverage area.

● It reduces interference from other signals.
